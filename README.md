# ESP8266-Joke-Database
This project is meant to be a fun exercise to the first evaluation of the subject on Microcontrollers on University of Pernambuco. This is the ESP8266 code that integrates a MongoDB database, an ESP and a 20x4 display.
The objective is to be a fun project: an eletronic display that shows random jokes continuously on a push of a button. On buttonpress, the displayed changes as another joke is pulled from the database.
